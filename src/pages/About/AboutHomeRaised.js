      <div id="Title">About Home Raised Cairns</div>
      <div id="AboutContent">
  

  Hello, my name is Dean Krotzer. I am a Full Stack Software Developer that lives with a few wonderful 
    Cairn Terriers.
    My home has no kennels! 
    All my dogs and puppies live with me and they are given attention daily.
    Not one puppy is born in a kennel and sold to whoever has money and wants to buy them.
    <br />
    <br />
    They make me and my kids laugh and smile every day.
    All my adult Cairns have ADA Service Dog registration and all have been proven to be exceptionally amazing at being a service animal.
    My Adult Cairns sleeps in bed with me and my kids every night.
    These Carins are not just dogs to us, they are family members!
    <br />
    <br />
    I have spent countless hours researching the best/worst foods, treats, training techniques, vaccinations, etc.
    I do my best to share knowledge about what I have learned about this amazing breed, without you having to research yourself. Hopefully, with my guidance, you can continue to have the 
    happiest and healthiest puppy it could be.
    <br />
    <br />
    I have never met a dog breed I did not like yet. I believe all breeds are amazing! I chose Cairns for my family 
    because they are hypoallergenic, smaller in size, lower shedding, great with kids, love to travel, loyal and
     not to forget they are fine with being a couch potato or running like the wind by your side. 
    I especially love how they retain their cuteness as they age into adults.

<div id="Title">Why Home Raised Cairns</div>
<div id="AboutContent">

 When you buy a puppy from Home Raised Cairns, you not just buying a dog that was raised in a home.
   Your buying from someone that not only cares a lot but shows it. I strive to ensure a superior puppy buying experience, puppy temperament, and quality.
 Buying from Home Raised Cairns is buying a higher standard Cairn. I always use the best options for vaccines 
 and never let cost affect a decision in providing the most optimal care regarding anything for any puppy from Home Raised Cairns.
  I dedicated hours daily to giving my cairns the time and attention they deserve. 
  <br />
    <br />
 As I am writing this Web App, 
 they are sleeping (i mean working tirelessly) by my side after we just got done running and playing outside. 
 I have years of research on what to feed, health, and how to ensure the best possible chance at a long healthy life for each puppy.
  Home Raised Cairns isn't just a hobby. Home Raised Cairns is something I take seriously and take significant time for and pride in.
  They are family right down to having my last name on their pedigree!

 <div id="Title"> A little more about Cairn Terriers The breed</div>
 <div id="AboutContent">


Cairn Terriers are great little dogs that are always ready for an adventure big or small. 
 They are ready to jump into a kayak, take a hike up a mountain, or go for a stroll through your local park.
 These little dogs are doers and need to be at your side whether it's snuggling up and watching a movie, working hard sleeping
 at your feet(while you do all the work), or riding in the car keeping you company.
 <br />
    <br />
 Cairns are very versatile dogs for many different lifestyles, they are great with children, other dogs/animals, 
 and not only need attention they crave it. Sure, Cairn terriers are cute and cuddly but these little dogs also used to be fierce little hunters of fox, badgers, otters, and other small rodents.
They hail from a Scotlands area of the world and Carin also means rock pile, which is somewhat what they use to hunt, live, and play on, on the isle of Skye.
