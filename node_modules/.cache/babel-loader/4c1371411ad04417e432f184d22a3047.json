They make me and my kids laugh and smile every day. They have helped my kids with more medical problems so much so that every adult cairn has an ADA service dog registration card! My Adult Cairns sleeps in bed with me and my kids every night. These Carins are not just dogs to us, they are family members!  So much of a family member they even have our last name their AKC pedigree! I have spent countless hours researching the best/worst foods, treats, training techniques, vaccinations, etc. I do my best to share knowledge about what I have learned about this amazing breed, without you having to research yourself with all the hours on the computer. Hopefully, with my guidance, you can continue to have the happiest and healthiest puppy it could be. I have never met a dog breed I did not like yet. I believe all breeds are amazing!
