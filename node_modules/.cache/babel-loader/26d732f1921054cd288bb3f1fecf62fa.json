I am a Full Stack Software Developer that lives with a few wonderful Cairn Terriers. My home has no kennels and I travel with my Cairns across the country a lot as I work remotely. All my dogs and puppies live with me and they are given attention daily. Not one puppy is born in a kennel and sold to whoever has money and wants to buy them. They make me and my kids laugh and smile every day. All my adult Cairns have ADA Service Dog registration and all have been proven to be exceptionally amazing at being a service animal. My Adult Cairns sleeps in bed with me and my kids every night. These Carins are not just dogs to us, they are family members! I have spent countless hours researching the best/worst foods, treats, training techniques, vaccinations, etc. I do my best to share knowledge about what I have learned about this amazing breed, without you having to research yourself. Hopefully, with my guidance, you can continue to have the happiest and healthiest puppy it could be. I have never met a dog breed I did not like yet. I believe all breeds are amazing! I chose Cairns for my family because they are hypoallergenic, smaller in size, lower shedding, great with kids, love to travel, loyal and not to forget they are fine with being a couch potato or running like the wind by your side. I especially love how they retain their cuteness as they age into adults.\"))));\n};\n\nexport default AboutHomeRaised;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/deankrotzer/Desktop/Github/Homeraisedcairns/homeraisedcairns/src/pages/About/AboutHomeRaised.js"],"names":["React","Component","Card","CardDeck","BrowserRouter","Link","AboutHomeRaised"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,IAAgBC,SAAhB,QAAiC,OAAjC;AACA,OAAO,YAAP;AACA,SAASC,IAAT,EAAeC,QAAf,QAAgC,iBAAhC;AACA,SAAQC,aAAR,EAAuBC,IAAvB,QAAmC,kBAAnC;;AAGA,MAAMC,eAAe,GAAG,MAAM;AAExB,sBACE;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,OAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACE;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,EAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBAEV;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,EAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACA;AAAK,IAAA,EAAE,EAAC,OAAR;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,8BADA,eAEA;AAAK,IAAA,EAAE,EAAC,aAAR;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBAEC;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,6jCAFD,CAFA,CAFU,eAmBT;AAAK,IAAA,EAAE,EAAC,OAAR;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,qDAnBS,eAoBN;AAAK,IAAA,EAAE,EAAC,aAAR;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBAEJ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,82BAFI,CApBM,eAgCT;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,IAhCS,eAiCT;AAAK,IAAA,EAAE,EAAC,OAAR;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,gCAjCS,eAkCT;AAAK,IAAA,EAAE,EAAC,aAAR;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBAEC;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,04CAFD,CAlCS,CADF,CADF;AA8DH,CAhEH;;AAkEE,eAAeA,eAAf","sourcesContent":["import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport '../App.css';\nimport { Card, CardDeck  } from 'react-bootstrap';\nimport{ BrowserRouter, Link } from 'react-router-dom';\n\n\nconst AboutHomeRaised = () => {\n    \n      return (\n        <div className=\"About\">\n          <div className=\"\">\n          \n<div className=\"\">\n<div id=\"Title\">Why Home Raised Cairns</div>\n<div id=\"PageContent\">\n\n <p>When you buy a puppy from Home Raised Cairns, you not just buying a dog that was raised in a home.\n   Your buying from someone that not only cares a lot but shows it.
