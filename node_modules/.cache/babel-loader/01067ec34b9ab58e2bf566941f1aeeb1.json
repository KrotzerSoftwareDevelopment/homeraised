Open Farm provides human-grade quality food, employs small farms, and produces a very healthy dog food! I feed open farm food to all my adult dogs and puppies. One of the best parts of open farm is there ingredients list is all able to be traced back to its source through their website.

My adult dogs are a fan of all the dry dog foods, they have had all the stews as a topper to dry dog food, bone broth is something I buy often for a treat and each bone broth bag lasts quite a while and they all love it! The training treats are amazing and the freeze-dried food is a favorite as well! My adult dogs and puppies I provide have an amazing quality of life and health and one of the reasons to thank for that is Open Farm!
