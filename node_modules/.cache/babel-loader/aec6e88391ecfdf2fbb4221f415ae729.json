The overall concept behind it is only rewarding positive behavior and discouraging any negative or bad behavior. While training using the PRT method no physical abuse like slapping or hitting should ever be done or needed. PRT is more effective than any other training method I have found and will never require slapping, hitting, or shocking. Again this goes for cairns all the way up to mastiffs, you never need to hit a dog to teach it. When training, avoid using their main source of food as a reward or this can lead to food bowl aggression. Also, when or if your puppy does something bad like pee on the floor or chew something they shouldn't slap or hit them. A good way to help avoid unwanted chewing is to help make sure they have toys of their own that aren't similar to other items in the house.\")), /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"p\", {\n    id: \"Title\",\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 26,\n      columnNumber: 3\n    }\n  }, \"Vaccines & Medications\"), /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"div\", {\n    id: \"PageContent\",\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 27,\n      columnNumber: 3\n    }\n  }, /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"p\", {\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 28,\n      columnNumber: 1\n    }\n  }, \"Do what your veterinarian recommends as certain vaccines are more crucial to have in different parts of the country than others.
